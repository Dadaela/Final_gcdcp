CodeBook.md is the code book that describes how the variables, the data, have been cleaned up

run_analysis.R allows us to prepare the data file as required by the project:
1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after performing all required steps
